# Analyzing-the-T20-cricket-data

- This project uses a regression model to analyze cricket scores with respective overs. The goal is to predict the cricket score for a given number of overs.

- Data: The data used in this project is a CSV file containing the following columns:

- Over: The number of overs played
- Score: The total number of runs scored
- Model: The regression model used in this project is a linear regression model. The model is trained on the data to learn the relationship between the number of overs and the cricket score.

## Usage: To use the model to predict the cricket score for a given number of overs, simply enter the number of overs into the model and it will predict the corresponding cricket score.


## Limitations:

- The model is only as good as the data it is trained on. If the data is noisy or incomplete, the model will not be able to make accurate predictions.
The model is a linear regression model, which means that it assumes that the relationship between the number of overs and the cricket score is linear. In reality, the relationship may be more complex.

## Future Work:

- Train the model on a larger and more comprehensive dataset.
- Use a more complex regression model, such as a support vector machine or a random forest.
- Develop a model that can predict the cricket score for a given number of overs and other factors, such as the type of pitch, the weather, and the teams playing.
